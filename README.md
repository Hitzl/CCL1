## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**  

### What Went Well:  
- **Drawings:** Creating the artwork took a long time, but I‚Äôm really happy with how it turned out.  
- **Boss Movement:** I successfully implemented a second phase for the boss fight, which added more depth to the gameplay.  

### Challenges:  
- **Implementing Spritesheets:** Getting the spritesheets to work properly was tough, as they caused performance issues. I was only able to fix it with some help.  
- **Drawings:** Doing all the artwork myself was challenging since I had no prior experience with drawing or digital art.  

### Lessons Learned:  
- **Managing Expectations:** I initially wanted to add a lot more details and features, but I realized that implementing them was much harder than expected.  
- **Drawing Skills:** I learned how to use digital drawing tools to create cool visuals, which was a valuable skill to pick up.
