Day 1:
On the first day, I focused on implementing the core movement mechanics for the spaceship, ensuring that it could navigate smoothly within the game world. I also set up the foundational game map, giving the player an environment to interact with. Additionally, I implemented the spaceship’s projectile system, allowing it to shoot and engage with potential enemies.

Day 2:
The second day was dedicated to expanding the game’s structure by enabling multiple levels, making it possible for the player to progress through different stages. I also implemented damage counters, which helped track how much damage enemies and the player were taking during combat.

Day 3:
On the third day, I started working on the design of the endboss, spending time drawing its appearance and planning how it would fit into the game. After finalizing its look, I implemented the endboss into the game, making it a functional and challenging encounter. I also attempted to create a projectile system for the enemies, but this part proved to be quite tricky and required additional work.

Day 4:
During the fourth day, I focused on improving enemy behavior by implementing movement patterns that made them more dynamic and challenging. I also spent time troubleshooting and addressing small bugs that were affecting the gameplay experience.

Day 5:
On the fifth day, I shifted my attention to the game’s user interface, designing and implementing both the start screen and the end screen. This helped give the game a more complete and polished feel by providing a structured beginning and conclusion.

Day 6:
The sixth day was dedicated to refining the boss fight, specifically focusing on Porkatron’s attack mechanics. I started by drawing Porkatron’s laser, ensuring that it matched the overall art style of the game. Once that was complete, I implemented Porkatron’s shooting pattern, making the boss fight more engaging and challenging for the player.

Day 7:
On the seventh day, I worked on improving the endboss fight by tweaking its movement and attack sequences to make it feel more dynamic and intense. I also began the process of creating spritesheets, which would later be used to animate various elements of the game.

Day 8:
The eighth day was mainly focused on creating spritesheets for the pig enemies, ensuring they had a smooth and visually appealing animation. However, when I tried to load the spritesheets into the game, I encountered performance issues, specifically lag, which made the gameplay less smooth. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find a solution to this problem at the time. Despite this setback, I also started implementing sound effects, which helped enhance the game’s atmosphere and overall experience.

Day 9:
On the ninth and final day, I dedicated my time to troubleshooting and attempting to fix the lag issues caused by loading the spritesheets. In addition, I fully implemented sound effects into the game, making it feel more immersive. I also made some minor adjustments to the movement mechanics to improve the overall gameplay feel. Lastly, I worked on fixing a few small bugs to ensure that the game was polished and ready to be played.
